# Password-Manager
This repository contains a password manager which stores and generates passwords

## Project Description
The Password Generator project is a user-friendly and secure tool designed to generate strong and unique passwords. With a focus on user privacy and data protection, this project ensures that passwords are only stored locally, offering an additional layer of security by eliminating the need for server storage.

By leveraging cryptographic algorithms, the Password Generator enables users to create passwords of varying lengths and complexity. The customizable options include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, allowing users to tailor their passwords to meet their specific security requirements.

One of the project's key advantages lies in its commitment to user privacy. By exclusively storing passwords locally, it eliminates the risk associated with centralized server storage, providing users with enhanced peace of mind regarding the protection of their sensitive information.

The Password Generator's intuitive interface makes it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. Additionally, the ability to copy generated passwords directly to the clipboard streamlines the password integration process across various applications and platforms.

With the inclusion of a password strength indicator, users can conveniently assess the robustness of their generated passwords. This visual feedback empowers users to make informed decisions about the strength and security of their chosen passwords.

Open-source in nature, the Password Generator project encourages collaboration, feedback, and customization from the developer community, fostering continuous improvement and innovation in the realm of password security.

## Key Features
